Flask-Selfdoc
=============

Flask-Selfdoc is a Flask extension that automatically creates documentation for your endpoints based on the routes, function arguments and docstrings. It was forked from [Flask-Autodoc](https://github.com/acoomans/flask-autodoc), written by Arnaud Coomans, and is completely compatible as a replacement for that extension. See the section on 'Compatibility' below.

## Requirements

Flask-Selfdoc is compatible with Python versions >=3.6 and Flask versions >=1.0. 
Previous versions of Flask-Selfdoc worked with Python 2.7, Python 3.5 and Flask 0.11 and 0.12. If you need a version which works with these old versions of Python and Flask, try 1.2.3 (but you are better off upgrading away from end-of-life Python!!!)

## Install

To install Flask-Selfdoc, run pip:

	pip install flask-selfdoc
	
or clone this directory and run setup:

    python setup.py install
    
or install via GitHub directly:

    pip install git+https://github.com/jwg4/flask-selfdoc.git@master

## Usage

Start using Flask-Selfdoc by importing it and initializing it:

    from flask import Flask
    from flask_selfdoc import Autodoc

    app = Flask(__name__)
    auto = Autodoc(app)

by default, Flask-Selfdoc will only document the routes explicitly decorated with _doc_:

    @app.route('/user/<int:id>')
    @auto.doc()
    def show_user(id):
        return user_from_database(id)

to generate the documentation, use the _html()_ method:

    @app.route('/documentation')
    def documentation():
        return auto.html()

## Compatibility

If your codebase uses Flask-Autodoc, you can swap it for Flask-Selfdoc by simply changing the name of the module in your import:

    from flask_selfdoc import Autodoc
    
instead of 

    from flask_autodoc import Autodoc
    
No other changes are necessary. Flask-Selfdoc 1.0 has exactly the same functionality as Flask-Autodoc 0.1.2, the most recent release at the time of the fork. Later versions of Flask-Selfdoc have added functionality but are still compatible with code that worked with Flask-Autodoc.

You can't import Flask-Selfdoc using the old naming scheme for Flask extensions, `flask.ext.foo`. This is deprecated by Flask and now fails to work on Flask 1.0.2. See the next section for details.

## ImportError with Flask 1.0.2

If you try to run Flask-Autodoc with Flask 1.0.2, you will get an ImportError which looks like this:

    >>> from flask_autodoc import Autodoc
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "/home/jwg4/autodoc_error/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask_autodoc/__init__.py", line 3, in <module>
        from flask.ext.autodoc.autodoc import Autodoc
    ImportError: No module named ext.autodoc.autodoc

This is because Flask no longer supports modules which are named `flask.ext.foo`. Even if you import Autodoc as above (from `flask_autodoc` instead of `flask.ext.autodoc`) the Flask-Autodoc code internally uses the old format and so the import will fail. In versions of Flask prior to 1.0.2, Flask-Autodoc caused a warning but did not fail. Flask-Selfdoc's first and main change from Flask-Autodoc was to fix this import so that it works with Flask 1.0.2, and so that the warning is not present with older versions.

If you imported Flask-Autodoc using the old syntax,

    from flask.ext.autodoc import Autodoc
 
 you should replace it with the new syntax. 
 
     from flask_selfdoc import Autodoc
 
 Changing from Flask-Selfdoc to Flask-Autodoc and changing your imports as above if needed, will mean that your code will work with Flask 1.0.2 and (hopefully) all future versions.

## Custom documentation

To access the documentation without rendering html:

    auto.generate()

the documentation will be returned as a list of rules, where each rule is a dictionary containing:

- methods: the set of allowed methods (ie ['GET', 'POST'])
- rule: relative url (ie '/user/&lt;int:id&gt;')
- endpoint: function name (ie 'show_user')
- docstring: docstring of the function
- args: function arguments
- defaults: defaults values for the arguments

This means you can do:

    @app.route('/documentation.json')
    def documentation():
        return jsonify(auto.generate())

or you could pass the output of `auto.generate()` to a Jinja template.

## Custom template

To use a custom template for your documentation, give a _template_ argument to the _html_ method. This will use a template from the flask _templates_ directory. 

Additional arguments (other than _group_, _groups_, and _template_) will be passed down to the template:

	auto.html(
		
		template='custom_documentation.html'
		
		title='My Documentation',
		author='John Doe',
	)
	

_title_ and _author_ will be available in the template:

	<!-- templates/custom_documentation.html -->
	...
	{% if title is defined %}
		{{title}}
	{% endif %}
	...

## Documentation sets

Endpoints can be grouped together in different documentation sets. It is possible, for instance, to show some endpoints to third party developers and have full documentation for primary developers.

To assign an endpoint to a group, pass the name of the group as argument of the _doc_ decorator:

    @app.route('/user/<int:id>')
    @auto.doc('public')
    def show_user(id):

to assign an endpoint to multiple groups, pass a list of group names as the _groups_ argument to _doc_:

    @app.route('/user/<int:id>')
    @auto.doc(groups=['public','private'])
    def show_user(id):

to generate the documentation for a specific group, pass the name of the group to the _html_ or _generate_ methods:

    auto.html('public')
    auto.html(groups=['public','private'])
    auto.generate('public')
    
## Examples

Apps in the _examples_ directory are an api for a blog:

- _simple_ is a simple app
- _factory_ uses blueprints

Run with

	python simple/blog.py
	
and connect to [/doc/public](http://127.0.0.1:5000/doc/public) and [/doc/private](http://127.0.0.1:5000/doc/private) to see public and private documentations.
